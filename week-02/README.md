# Smart Student Grade Calculator

## Description
This program is a smart calculator that collects a student's test, assignment, and exam scores and calculates the total score. It also determines whether the student has passed and if they qualify for an award based on defined conditions.

## Scoring Structure
- Test score: out of 20
- Assignment score: out of 30
- Exam score: out of 50
- Total score: out of 100

## Logic Used
- Total score is calculated by summing all score components.
- A student passes if the total score is 50 or above.
- A student qualifies for an award if the average score is 70 and above and test score is 15 or above and assignment score is 25 or above or exam score is 45 or above.

## How To Run The Program
1. Navigate to the `week-02` directory.
2. Run the script using: ``python smart_grade_calculator.py``
3. Enter the required scores when prompted.

## Expected Output
