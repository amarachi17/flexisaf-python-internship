# User Profile Manager (Python)

## Description
This project is a reusable Python script that interactively collects a user's profile information, validates inputs, saves the profile to a pretty-printed JSON file, and can read and display the saved profile.

The script demonstrates proper use of functions, input validation, file handling, and JSON serialization in Python.

## Features
- Interactive user profile collection
- Input validation to ensure data correctness
- Pretty-printed JSON file storage (`profile.json`)
- Ability to read and display saved profile data
- Clean, reusable, and well-structured code

## Files
- `profile_manager.py` - Main Python script
- `profile.json` - Generated JSON file containing the saved user profile

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 installed

## How to run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `week-01` directory: cd week-01
3. Run the script: python profile_manager.py
4. When prompted, choose an option:
- **1** to create and save a new profile
- **2** to view an existing saved profile
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter or view profile details.

## Example Usage
- Select option **1** to enter your name, email, and age.
- The profile will be saved as `profile.json` in the same directory.
- Select option **2** to load and display the saved profile.

## Concepts Practiced
- Functions and modular code
- Input validation
- File handling 
- JSON serialization and deserialization
