# Learning Log - Flexisaf Internship

## Week 1
- Learned: Python basics, functions, file handling, JSON
- Built: User Profile Manager script
- Challenges: Input validation and file handling
- Improvements: Code structure and reusability

## Week 02
## Variables, Arithmetic and Logic

# What I Learned
- Using variables to store user input
- Performing arithemetic calculations
- Applying comparison and logical operators
- Implementing conditional statements for decision making

# Challenges Faced
- Understanding weighted scoring systems
- Differentiating between total and averge scores

# Key Takeaway
Real-world problems often require weighted logic rather than simple averages.


## Week 03
## Decision Making & Control Flow

# What I Learned
- How to use if and else statements to control program flow
- Applying comparison and logical operators to real-life problems
- Writing clear decision-making logic based on user input
- Structuring multiple tasks in a single Python script

# Tasks Completed
- Age validation program
- Login authentication flow
- Loan eligibility checker
- Expense tracker with overspending detection

# Challenges Faced
- Designing clear conditions for loan eligibility
- Ensuring login remains readable when handling multiple tasks in one file.

# Key Takeaway
Clear decision making logic is essential for building reliable applications, especially when handling user input and real world rules.

  ## Week 04
  ## Secure Finance Assistant

  # What I Learned
  This week focused on decision-making and loop-based logic in Python.
  I learned how to:

- Evaluate password strength using conditional checks
- Apply logical rules to score user input
- Use while loops for continuous user interaction
- Store structured data using lists and dictionaries
- Summarize data using for loops

# Challenges Faced
- Designing clear password evaluation rules
- Structuring expense data for easy summarization
- Ensuring the program remained user-friendly

# How I Solved Them
- Broke problems into smaller logical steps
- Used Python built-in functions like `any()`
- Added clear comments and meaningful variable names

# Outcome
I successfully built a console-based finance assistant that simulates real-world user interaction and demonstrates foundational backend skills.
